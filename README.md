Personal website of Joel McBeth located at http://joelmcbeth.com.

This is my attempt at learning and/or practicing Angular, TypeScript and ASP.NET Core.

At this point I am not using EF core because I think it is lacking basic features needed for use. Such as many to many relationships with an implict joining table.
