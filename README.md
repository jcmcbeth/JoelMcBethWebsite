This is my attempt at learning and/or practicing Angular, TypeScript and ASP.NET Core.

This started out as AngularJS, JavaScript, ASP.NET Core and ADO.NET. I am migrating the project to use Angular, TypeScript, and EntityFramework.

There were reasons I didn't want to use the Entity Framework Core because of certain features it didn't support. But after some consideration and the support of Entity Framework 6 on .NET core I want to migrate towards either one.

At this point I have migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript.
